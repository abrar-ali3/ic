									<h2>About</h2>
									<p>The Illuminated Cities Project seeks to address racial, religious, socioeconomic, and physical segregation that youth face as obstacles to becoming self-actualized contributors towards a more socially just and compassionate world.</p>
									<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong> The Illuminated Cities Project is a youth empowerment program that aims to utilize international travel as a catalyst for youth development. We are focused on working with high school aged students and have three key foci to inspire our youth towards social innovation: creative arts, sustainable development, and peace/reconciliation through athletics. Through a twelve-month fellowship program, Illuminated will provide students the skills and support they need to develop a plan to improve the conditions of their community. By bringing together youth from racially, religiously, socio-economically, and geographically different places, Illuminated will create a network of resources for students who can share insights and work together as social innovators for their communities. One month of the fellowship will be spent abroad so that fellows can meet other young people from around the globe to see how they are improving their communities.  The program will culminate when youth return to the U.S. and put their plans into practice that Illuminated will continue to support and evaluate with them.</p>

									<h2>About</h2>
									<p><strong>Vision:</strong>Illuminated Cities envisions a world where interdependence and exchange of ideas serve to make the world a socially just place. By getting young social innovators to interact with more experienced change-agents in international communities, a collective process can take place where the youth are able to address social challenges on a local level with inspiration and best practices from international models.</p>
									<p><strong>Mission:</strong> The Illuminated Cities Project seeks to give young people, especially those in communities affected by segregation, an opportunity for leadership, self-development, and community-development in an international context. Fellows in the program build life skills, develop an Action Plan for their home-community, and are partnered with a mentor and a local organization to help them implement their Action Plan on the ground level. The fellows will be social innovators for their home-communities, creating a cycle of revitalization and development.</p>
									<p><strong>Target Population:</strong>  In the United States, our target population is youth in communities affected by segregation, especially Detroit, Chicago, and New York City, three of America’s most segregated cities. As an overall project, however, we aim to bridge gaps and inspire action through evoking dialogue among youth in global contexts.</p>

									<h2>Pilot Project</h2>
									<p>During December 22-29, 2012, the Illuminated Cities Project launched its pilot project. Our team was comprised of <strong>one suburban fellow (Alina Raza), one urban fellow (Yaqueline Rodriguez), a youth documentarian (Shaiz Raza), an adult ally (Xian Barrett), and the project director (Zehra Imam).</strong></p>
									<p><a href="http://youtu.be/TtEXiNfOi4w" class="link1">Learn More About The Fellows In This Video!</a></p>
									<p><strong>Prior to traveling to Mexico</strong> our team engaged in conversations about cultural sensitivity and culture shock in the American and global contexts. Fellows did reflections and tele-conferenced with one another about their lives and experiences with education.</p>
									<p><a href="#!/page_Pilot_In_Mexico1" class="link1">What We Did In Mexico City.</a></p>
									<p><strong>Fellows Speak:</strong> <a href="#!/page_Pilot_Quotes1" class="link1">Quotes From The Youth</a><br>Youth said they returned with a better understanding of need in global communities, including how that need is addressed, and said that they would use their experience to implement an Action Plan of growth and development for their home cities.</p>
									<p><strong>Evaluation Plan:</strong><br>Youth and mentors filled out post-­departure surveys and evaluated their experiences.</p>

									<h2>Mexico City</h2>
									<p><strong>We had workshops on:</strong><br> - Sustainability for self and community <br>-­ Action Plans for our fellows<br>‐ Speaker‐Listener series to get to know one another and others in the Mexican context</p>
									<p><strong>We met with faith communities to learn about culture, interfaith exchange of ideas, and fellowship:</strong><br>-­ In the Mexican Christian community, we went to church for Christmas mass and had dinner with a family.<br>- In the Muslim community, we observed/participated in Friday prayers, and met with local community members for lunch.</p>
									<p>We also met with social entrepreneurs in the Mexican context so that our youth could gain an understanding of how they could implement their projects through individuals such as <a href="http://www.innovalius.com/NuestroDirector.html" class="link1">Jorge Olmos</a> and organizations such as <a href="http://www.espiritudecampeon.org.mx/" class="link1">Espirit du Campeon. </a>We discovered how artists are using creative arts as a medium for social change through organizations such as <a href="http://www.danceability.com/danceability_latin_america.php" class="link1">Danceability-Mexico. </a>We worked with our team on creating and building partnerships in the Mexican context as well as with one another to build a sustainable network of support upon return from the program.</p>

									<h2>Quotes From The Youth</h2>
									<p>"I learned that money is not everything. You don't have to be rich to give back. I learned community is family. Faith is having hope, and it does not necessarily have to be for those who are "weak". That's what I learned."<br>- <strong>Yaqueline Rodriguez, Chicago fellow</strong></p>
									<p>"The Mexico trip really opened me up and I was able to talk about things I had held in. While I was there, people were extremely nice and it made my attitude more open and happy. I met Jakie and Mr. Barrett and they were nice people... what I got out of the trip was that it made me believe that project ideas can be effective and show how other countries work in comparison to America and how everything that is so readily available for us might not be in some other countries." <br>- <strong>Shais Raza, Detroit fellow</strong></p>
									<p>"I had anticipated going to Mexico for months on end. The trip was kind of surreal in a way, the night before leaving, I was shaking with anticipation and excitement, but as soon as we landed in Mexico City, all of that washed away and I was left with a calm and collected version of myself. I had promised myself before embarking on this trip to have no expectations and to basically roll with the punches. I honestly did not know what to expect and how I would react to a new culture and country.<a href="#!/page_Pilot_Quotes2" class="link1">Continue...</a> - <a href="#!/page_Pilot_Project1" class="link1">Return</a></p>

									<h2>Quotes From The Youth</h2>
									<p>The trip turned out to be an amazing experience. I met two [new] awesome individuals, Xian Barret and Jakie Rodrigeuz that will hopefully continue to be a large part of my journey. I also became acquainted with amazing social entrepreneurs creating awesome programs with their communities for their communities. Though I didn't know the language or the customs and didn't particularly enjoy the food, I felt a connection with these people. They faced the same struggles we did with ourselves and within our communities. And much like we are trying to do, they are actively and successfully creating that change. It was a beautiful thing to experience. The world seems like a much smaller place after coming back from Mexico. Humans are the same across the globe." <br>– <strong>Alina Raza, Detroit fellow</strong></p>

									<h2>Events</h2>
									 <p><strong>Educated in America: Voices from a Broken System</strong> is our first event and our goal is to have youth voices sharing their stories throughout our event. During our panel, students will speak specifically about how they are impacted by segregation, resource allocation to school communities, as well as discuss the work they have done/are doing in their communities. We will also discuss how travel and creative arts can be revitalizing tools for youth empowerment and community-building.<br><strong><a href="#!/page_Event1_Attendee_List1" class="link1">Confirmed Individuals and Organizations</a></strong></p>

									 <p>1.<strong>Majora Carter:</strong> As part of the Illuminated Cities' advisory board, Majora helps the team with bringing its vision to life. Carter, who was awarded a 2005 MacArthur "genius" grant, served as executive director of Sustainable South Bronx for 7 years, where she pushed both for eco-friendly practices (such as green and cool roofs) and, equally important, job training and green-related economic development for her vibrant neighborhood on the rise. Since leaving SSBx in 2008, Carter has formed the economic consulting and planning firm the Majora Carter Group, to bring her pioneering approach to communities far outside the South Bronx. Carter is working within the cities of New Orleans, Detroit and the small coastal towns of Northeastern North Carolina. The Majora Carter Group is putting the green economy and green economic tools to use, unlocking the potential of every place -- from urban cities and rural communities, to universities, government projects, businesses and corporations -- and everywhere else in between.</p>
									 <p>2. <strong>Gage Park High School students from Voices of Youth in Chicago's Education (VOYCE) </strong>have done work surrounding harsh discipline, school to prison pipeline, organizing Chicago teacher strikes as well as walk-outs for standardized tests. Joel Rodriguez (youth organizer), Yaqueline Rodriguez (former Gage Park High School student and Illuminated fellow), and Timothy (current Gage Park HS student) will be present. Both, Joel and Yaqueline, have global travel experience, and were instrumental in helping with a mural project directed by founder/director Zehra Imam.<a href="#!/page_Event1_Attendee_List2" class="link1">Continued...</a> - <a href="#!/page_Events_And_Tours_Main1" class="link1">Return</a></p>
